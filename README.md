# Friday Night Funkin' - Grafex Engine
Engine designed to fix some bugs and minor graphics updates and new features. Also aiming to be an easier alternative to newbie coders.

## Installation:
You must have [the most up-to-date version of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/), seriously, stop using 4.1.5, it misses some stuff.

Follow a Friday Night Funkin' source code compilation tutorial, after this you will need to install LuaJIT.

To install LuaJIT do this: `haxelib install linc_luajit` on a Command prompt/PowerShell

...Or if you don't want your mod to be able to run .lua scripts, delete the "LUA_ALLOWED" line on Project.xml

## Cool new Chart Editor changes and countless bug fixes
![](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine/blob/main/docs/img/chart.png?raw=true)
* You can now chart "Event" notes, which are bookmarks that trigger specific actions that usually were hardcoded on the vanilla version of the game.
* Your song's BPM can now have decimal values
* You can manually adjust a Note's strum time if you're really going for milisecond precision
* You can change a note's type on the Editor, it comes with two example types:
  * Alt Animation: Forces an alt animation to play, useful for songs like Ugh/Stress
  * Hey: Forces a "Hey" animation instead of the base Sing animation, if Boyfriend hits this note, Girlfriend will do a "Hey!" too.

## Small changes in TitleState MainMenuState and StoryMenuState
